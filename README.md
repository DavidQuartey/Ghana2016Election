# 2016 Ghana Election
 Contains data (.csv) and R code used for [this](https://medium.com/simpleeconomics/facts-about-ghanas-parliamentary-candidates-and-regions-political-parties-are-hoping-to-win-seats-6a7a0b1f9c7b?source=collection_home---6------2-----------) 2016 Ghana Election analysis, where I concluded that:

>The Upper West is one region popular among most of the parties analysed. The Ashanti Region is certainly being targeted by PNC and GCPP. NDP is eyeing Volta Region, and APC favoring itself in the North of Ghana. 
It will be interesting to see how the Parliamentary elections play out and if the several other parties can win a seat or two with their strategies.
